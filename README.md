# 3D-Modelling-Experiments-for-IMPULSE-Project-
The 3D models are all available on Google Drive via this link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GkrvJJot1qbObbs317aOX7-zqX0HCT_o/view?usp=sharing
](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TIm61sD58sVkMQDxQ9hCOtJZNOzgdvMw?usp=drive_link). To utilize the models, please download Blender. After downloading the .blend files, click on the files to open them. To see the textures, press on the Viewport Shading button in top right corner of the 3D Viewport. The objects that were turned into 3D models belong to the Disactic Museum of Archaeology and KU Leuven Libraries collections. The models were created as part of an internship that is connected to Work Package 1 of the “IMmersive digitization: uPcycling cULtural heritage towards new reviving StratEgies” (IMPULSE) project. The models were created to explore the potential of 3D modelling before the first workshop on the 18th of February 2025. The goal of the workshop is to see how 2D objects can be integrated into a 3D world. To learn more about the project, please visit the website: https://euimpulse.eu/.
